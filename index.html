      <h1>React Query Demo – Interactive Cache Visualizer</h1>
      <p>
        This interactive demo by Hamed Panjeh visualizes React Query (TanStack
        Query) caching, stale time, gcTime, garbage collection, and background
        refetching to help developers understand data-fetching lifecycle at a
        glance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Features: live cache countdown timers, mount/unmount simulation, user
        data fetching, stale vs fresh indicators, and garbage collection
        monitoring.
      </p>
      <h2>How to Use This React Query Demo</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Mount Your First User</strong> — Click the green "Mount"
          button on any user's card. React Query makes a real API call and
          starts a 30-second stale-time countdown.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mount a Second User</strong> — Mount another user while the
          first is still active. Both run independently with their own data and
          countdowns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unmount and Re-mount While Fresh</strong> — Unmount a user,
          then re-mount within 30 seconds. Data loads instantly from cache—no
          network request.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Watch Data Become Stale</strong> — After 30 seconds the data
          becomes stale (orange). React Query will refetch on the next trigger.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Show Child Component</strong> — Click "Show Child Component"
          inside a mounted user's card to see cache sharing. Parent and child
          use the same cached data—observer count increases.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hide Child Component</strong> — Hiding the child reduces the
          observer count but the cache remains active.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unmount a User</strong> — Click "Unmount" on a user's card.
          The 60-second garbage-collection countdown begins for that user only.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Re-mount Before GC</strong> — Mount the user again before 60
          seconds. Cached data appears instantly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wait for Garbage Collection</strong> — Let the GC timer
          expire. The cache is permanently removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mount After GC</strong> — Mount the user again after GC. A
          fresh API call is made—completing the full lifecycle.
        </li>
      </ol>
