      <h1>React Query Demo – Interactive Cache Visualizer</h1>
      <p>
        This interactive demo by Hamed Panjeh visualizes React Query (TanStack
        Query) caching, stale time, gcTime, garbage collection, and background
        refetching to help developers understand data-fetching lifecycle at a
        glance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Features: live cache countdown timers, mount/unmount simulation, user
        data fetching, stale vs fresh indicators, and garbage collection
        monitoring.
